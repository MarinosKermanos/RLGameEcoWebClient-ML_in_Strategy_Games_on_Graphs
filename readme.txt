Machine Learning in Strategy Games on Graphs.
This Thesis ( 2021-2022) concerns the development of a technical ecosystem, for the implementation of strategy games with the use of machine learning techniques. 
In particular, I will deal with the existing basis of the ecosystem, evolving it and adding more functions, which will be performed using artificial intelligence on different graphs.
This folder implements the Webclient(RLGameEcoWebClient) of the Ecosystem.
